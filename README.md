[![Passing Tests](https://github.com/CuckooEXE/dpython/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CuckooEXE/dpython/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is (dumb) Python, with a number of (dumb) enhancements that will make your life ~more confusing~ easier. Please don't actually use this, this is just me messing around with Python to learn its internals, and to learn more about programming languages.

## Features

 - None :)

## TODO

 - [ ] IP Addresses as native types
 - [ ] Integer increment operator
 - [ ] Implicit `str` + `int` concatenation

## Testing

```bash
./configure
make -j`nproc` test
```
